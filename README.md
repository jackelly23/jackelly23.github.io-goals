# My Goals

After College, my goals are to head back to Colorado and work for State Farm as an insurance adjuster. At some point after working for a few years I do wish to go back to school to complete my masters in Economics to see where this will take me. When I graduate from the University of Missouri in a week, one of my greatest goals in my life will be crossed off the list.
